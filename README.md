# Kakfa

A Python-based Apache Kafka project for producing and consuming event streams — including a simple fraud-detection workflow.

This repository demonstrates key Kafka patterns such as sending messages to a Kafka topic and processing/consuming them for analytics (e.g., fraud detection). It’s ideal for learning and prototyping event-driven applications with Kafka in Python.

## 🧠 Overview

This project has two main components:

### 1. Kafka Producer — `send_to_kafka`

A module that:

- Connects to a Kafka broker  
- Publishes messages (e.g., synthetic transaction data)  
- Demonstrates using Kafka producers in Python

### 2. Kafka Consumer / Fraud Detection — `fraud-detection`

A simple consumer that:

- Listens to a Kafka topic  
- Processes messages to detect fraud (could be rule-based or ML-based)  
- Outputs alerts or logs when suspicious activity is found

## 📦 Features

✔ Python Kafka Producer & Consumer  
✔ Easy setup for local Kafka testing  
✔ Example fraud-detection flow  
✔ Instructions to run components independently
